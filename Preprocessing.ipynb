I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2     Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3     PROS: Italian hoagie was delicious.  Friendly counter employee. The restaurant was clean and neat. \\n\\nCONS: The pizza was not good.  Pre-formed crust, NOT fresh dough.  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER.  \\n\\nI guess the name says it all.

       "4     First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there's no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74\\n\\nSo I'm thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12\" hoagie these will be awesome. \\n\\nI was sadly mistaken. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. \\n\\nSo on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. \\n\\nSecond, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. \\nNo cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I've ever eaten. \\nI'm not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. \\nCheck out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "5     Normally, I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad.  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr. Hoagie, I would not be writing this bad review.  On my first and last trip there, I paid $24.59 for two whole hoagies.  \\n\\n1) The Italian (ordered because the woman (she) working there told me it was their most popular hoagie) I ordered with lettuce and onions (no tomato, italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie).  I had to pay $1 to add cheese to the hoagie.  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away, I asked for the italian on the side.  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side.  I passed on that on principle.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved her money by declining the tomato.  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side.  At this point, I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble.  That pales in comparison to what happened next.  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie.  Ham, salami, and bologna.  Bologna!?!?!?!?    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie?  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian.  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view.  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna, no ham and no salami.\\n\\n2)  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce, tomato, onions, and dressing.  I ordered it without lettuce, tomato, onions, or dressing.  I asked for mayo on the side.  I had to pay for that so I declined.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, and dressing!  I paid $3 to add sautéed mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  Here we go again.  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through (were still cold) and onions that were still crunchy/undercooked.  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been sautéed (canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble).  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it.  The hoagie was 50% mushrooms, 30%onions, 10% cheese and 10% steak.\\n\\nI could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the $24.59 I paid for these two whole hoagies.  I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants to support small businesses.  In this case, Never. Again.  (The hoagie bun was better than average.)  Wake up or you are going to lose your business.\n",
       "6     I like this place a lot. It's a good toasted hoagie.\\n\\nI actually don't like a my bun exploding with meat, but as a previous poster mentioned if you do maybe you wouldn't like this place.\\n\\nThe inside badly needs updated though. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "17    This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "19    This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\\n\\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \\n\\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\\n\\n-Fish Sandwiich\\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\\n-Flounder\\n-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\\n-Hawkins St Special\\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\\n\\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
